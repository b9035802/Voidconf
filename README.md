# Voidconf
Void Linux Config Files (Dotfiles)

- Scripts are located in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings are mostly in `~/.config/` for:
	- [neo]vim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- mpd (music)
	- mpv (video)
	- sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
	
<b>N.B. Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`</b>

## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to go with suckless programs from the suckless devs, I use the following builds from [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz):

- [dwm](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwm) (window manager)
- [dwmblocks](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks) (statusbar)
- [st](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) (terminal emulator)
- [mutt-wizard](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard) (CLI email)
